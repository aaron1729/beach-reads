this is the code behind this webpage. `main.py` enables an AI chatbot to "think" before writing a ~1000-word "beach read" vignette.

`conda create --name beach-reads python=3.9` (to create a conda environment), then activate with `conda activate beach-reads` (and deactivate with `conda deactivate`).
`

install packages via `conda install -c conda-forge PACKAGE_NAME` (rather than `pip install PACKAGE_NAME`).
