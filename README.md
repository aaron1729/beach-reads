In the essay [ChatGPT vs. Me: Who Will Write a Better Beach Read?](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/09/opinion/chatgpt-beach-read.html), author Curtis Sittenfeld proposes a head-to-head competition against ChatGPT ("in its current iteration"), to see who can write a better "beach read". She asks her readers to select five topics from a list that she provides, and then explains the parameters.

> Both stories will be the same length (1,000 words), and both will incorporate the same five prompts. ChatGPT, which will be told to write in my style, will complete its story in a few seconds; I’ll complete mine in a few weeks.

She explains her motivations as follows.

> So it may go without saying that in this contest, I’m rooting for myself; I’m Team Human, and I’m hoping to honorably defend my species. But as with the steel-driving John Henry and the chess-playing Garry Kasparov before me, the outcome is unknown in advance. Maybe fiction writers’ jobs are in danger, or maybe there’s some ineffable quality, similar to the transcendent quality of a beach read, that still separates a story told by a person from a story told by a computer.

However, this arrangement does not constitute a true head-to-head competition. This is because, as is often touted, ChatGPT is merely "predicting the next word". If ChatGPT is asked to write the story in a single shot, then an appropriate head-to-head competition would require Sittenfeld to narrate her own story from start to finish in real time. Of course, that would surely not showcase the best of her writing abilities. A better competition would be to allow both Sittenfeld and ChatGPT to actually "think" before they begin writing.[^1]

This repository contains a very simple Python script that enables ChatGPT to "think" and then write a story, based on five topics and in the style of Sittenfeld (or another author of the user's choice).

[^1] In ChatGPT's case, an apt name for this process is "unhobbling", in the sense that Leopold Aschenbrenner writes about [here](https://situational-awareness.ai/). Specifically, by construction, ChatGPT is "hobbled" (in comparison with its full cognitive capabilities) inasmuch as it is required to construct its responses one word at a time, without any possibility of meta-level thinking or revision.
