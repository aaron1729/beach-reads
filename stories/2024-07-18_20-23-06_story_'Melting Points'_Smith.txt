Melting Points

a story by Claude about ice cream, sand, constipation, the Midwest, and sunscreen

Amira squinted against the glare of the Midwest sun, her hand hovering uncertainly over the array of ice cream flavors behind the smudged glass. Corn Silk Surprise? Hoosier Huckleberry? Christ, she thought, even the desserts here were aggressively provincial. The tinny jangle of the shop's bell announced another customer, and she felt a bead of sweat trickle down her spine, mingling with the sticky residue of hastily applied sunscreen. Todd's hand found the small of her back, and she flinched, painfully aware of her body's betrayal – three days of his mother's home cooking had left her bloated and constipated, a fact she'd sooner die than admit to her boyfriend's relentlessly cheerful family. "How about the Buckeye Bonanza?" Todd suggested, oblivious to her internal turmoil. "It's a local favorite." Amira nodded, resigned to another Midwestern curiosity, and silently prayed that the ice cream wouldn't melt before they reached the beach. Sand and dairy, she mused, what could possibly go wrong?

Amira gingerly accepted the cone, its girth comically oversized for her slender fingers. As they stepped out into the sweltering heat, she caught sight of their reflection in the parlor's window – Todd, all cornfed enthusiasm in his garish Hawaiian shirt, and herself, a study in reluctant participation. The contrast was stark, almost funny, if it weren't so bloody uncomfortable.

The walk to the beach was mercifully short, but with each step, Amira felt the ice cream softening, threatening to break free from its waffle prison. She'd barely made it onto the sand when disaster struck – a glob of Buckeye Bonanza plopped unceremoniously onto her foot, followed swiftly by the entire scoop.

"Oh, shoot," Todd said, reaching for napkins that weren't there. "Don't worry, I'll get you another one."

But Amira was frozen, staring at the melting mound of brown and yellow slowly being consumed by the sand. It was, she realized with a start, a perfect metaphor for how she felt – out of place, dissolving under scrutiny, and frankly, a bit nutty.

Todd's family had already claimed a spot on the beach, their patchwork of towels and umbrellas resembling a haphazard Midwestern favela. His mother, Deb, waved enthusiastically, her other hand clutching a dog-eared romance novel with a shirtless cowboy on the cover.

"There you are!" Deb called out. "We were starting to think you'd gotten lost in the ice cream parlor."

Amira forced a smile, acutely aware of the sticky residue between her toes. "Just taking our time," she replied, her British accent suddenly feeling as out of place as a opera singer at a monster truck rally.

Todd's grandmother, a wiry woman with a shock of white hair, peered at Amira over her cat-eye sunglasses. "You look a mite uncomfortable, dear. Everything alright?"

Amira opened her mouth to reassure her, but instead found herself blurting out, "I'm constipated."

The beach seemed to fall silent, save for the distant cry of a seagull that sounded suspiciously like laughter.

Todd's face turned a shade of red that rivaled the setting sun, while Deb's eyes widened in a mix of shock and motherly concern. But it was Grandma who broke the tension, cackling with unexpected delight.

"Well, honey, why didn't you say so earlier?" She rummaged through her oversized beach bag, pulling out a small bottle. "I've got just the thing. Prune juice. Never leave home without it."

Amira stared at the proffered bottle, torn between mortification and a desperate desire for relief. She glanced at Todd, who seemed to be contemplating whether it was possible to drown oneself in ankle-deep water.

"I... thank you," Amira managed, accepting the bottle with as much dignity as she could muster. She unscrewed the cap and took a tentative sip, surprised to find it wasn't entirely unpleasant.

"Now," Grandma said, patting the sand beside her, "why don't you sit down and tell me about that fancy university of yours in London? I hear they've got buildings older than our whole darn country."

As Amira settled beside Grandma, she felt a strange sense of relief wash over her. The old woman's frankness was oddly comforting, a stark contrast to the polite tiptoeing she'd grown accustomed to since arriving in the Midwest.

"Well," Amira began, "my college was founded in 1826, which I suppose is practically prehistoric by American standards."

Grandma chuckled. "Honey, in this town, anything older than the Reagan administration is considered ancient history."

They chatted amiably, Amira's anxiety slowly melting away like ice cream on hot sand. She found herself sharing stories of London, her Pakistani heritage, and her studies in comparative literature. Grandma listened intently, occasionally interjecting with surprisingly insightful questions and wry observations.

As the afternoon wore on, Amira realized she felt more at ease than she had since arriving. The prune juice worked its magic, both literally and metaphorically, loosening not just her intestines but also the knot of tension she'd been carrying.

As the sun began to dip towards the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, Amira found herself laughing at one of Grandma's outrageous stories about Todd's childhood misadventures.

"You know," Grandma said, her eyes twinkling, "you remind me a bit of myself when I was your age. Always feeling a little out of place, too smart for your own good."

Amira smiled, touched by the unexpected connection. "I never thought I'd find common ground over prune juice and constipation," she quipped.

Grandma let out a hearty laugh. "Oh, honey, life's full of surprises. Sometimes the things that make us most uncomfortable end up bringing us closer together."

As if on cue, Todd appeared, looking sheepish. "Everything okay over here?"

Amira reached for his hand, giving it a gentle squeeze. "More than okay," she replied, realizing she meant it.

As they packed up to leave, Amira cast one last glance at the lake, its surface shimmering in the fading light. She smiled, thinking of the ice cream melting into the sand earlier. Perhaps, like that Buckeye Bonanza, she too could find a way to blend into this unfamiliar landscape, adding her own unique flavor to the mix. With a newfound lightness in her step – thanks in no small part to Grandma's prune juice – Amira linked arms with Todd and headed back to the car, ready to face whatever Midwestern curiosities awaited her next.
