Midnight Tides

a story by Claude about skinny-dipping, beer, pop songs, sweat, and regret

The air hung thick and heavy, a blanket of heat that refused to lift even as night fell over Lagos. Adanna pressed the cool bottle of Star beer against her forehead, relishing the brief respite it offered. Around her, laughter and chatter bubbled up from her friends, a mix of pidgin and English that once felt like home but now sounded almost foreign to her ears. The distant thump of Wizkid's latest hit drifted from a nearby bar, mingling with the rhythmic crash of waves against the shore. She dug her toes into the sand, still warm from the day's unrelenting sun, and took a long swig of beer. Five years in America, and yet here she was, right back where she started – sweating on a Lagos beach, caught between worlds.

Adanna watched as her childhood friend, Chioma, twirled in the moonlight, her dark skin glistening with sweat. "Oya now, let's go for a swim!" Chioma called out, her voice carrying a hint of mischief. The others whooped in agreement, already peeling off their clothes.

Adanna hesitated, her fingers tightening around the bottle. In Boston, skinny-dipping was a rebellious thrill. Here, it felt different – dangerous, almost sacrilegious. She thought of her mother's disapproving gaze, of the childhood lectures on modesty and propriety.

"Adanna, stop forming ajebutter," Emeka teased, using the slang for a spoiled rich kid. "You've forgotten how to be Nigerian, abi?"

The words stung more than they should have. Adanna stood, her decision made before she fully realized it. She pulled her dress over her head in one fluid motion, letting it fall to the sand. The night air kissed her skin, both thrilling and terrifying.

As they raced towards the water, Adanna felt a rush of exhilaration mixed with a gnawing sense of unease. The ocean enveloped her, cool and vast, washing away the day's sweat and grime. For a moment, she felt free – unbound by expectations, cultures, or continents.

But as she floated on her back, staring up at the star-studded sky, doubt crept in like the tide. Who was she becoming? And at what cost?

A familiar melody drifted across the water – Beyoncé's "Halo" playing from someone's phone on the shore. Adanna closed her eyes, memories washing over her like waves. She remembered dancing to this song in her dorm room, drunk on cheap wine and the promise of a new life in America. Now, the lyrics felt bittersweet, a reminder of the person she'd become – or perhaps, the person she'd left behind.

"Adanna!" Chioma's voice cut through her reverie. "Come, we're playing truth or dare!"

As Adanna swam towards her friends, a flicker of movement on the beach caught her eye. Her heart leapt into her throat. "Guys," she hissed, "I think someone's watching us."

Panic rippled through the group. They scrambled towards the shore, a tangle of limbs and squeals. Adanna's feet hit the sand, and she ran, snatching up her dress and pulling it over her wet body. The others did the same, their laughter tinged with nervous energy.

Back on their towels, they huddled close, passing around the remaining beers. The adrenaline of their mad dash slowly gave way to giddy relief. Emeka regaled them with an exaggerated account of their escape, his hands gesticulating wildly. Adanna found herself laughing along, swept up in the camaraderie.

Yet, as the night wore on, a familiar restlessness settled in her chest. She excused herself, walking along the water's edge, the warm sand yielding beneath her feet.

The ocean stretched out before her, vast and unknowable, much like the future she had once imagined for herself. Adanna thought of the life she'd built in Boston – the corporate job, the sleek apartment, the American boyfriend who tried to pronounce her name correctly but never quite managed it. She had worked so hard to fit in, to shed the parts of herself that felt too Nigerian, too foreign. And yet, here she was, feeling just as out of place as she had five years ago.

A cool breeze swept in from the water, raising goosebumps on her damp skin. Adanna wrapped her arms around herself, suddenly aware of how exposed she felt – not just physically, but emotionally. The reckless joy of skinny-dipping had faded, leaving behind a hollowness she couldn't quite name.

She thought of her mother, of the disapproving click of her tongue when Adanna had announced her plans to stay in America after graduation. "Don't forget where you come from," she had said, her voice heavy with unspoken fears. At the time, Adanna had bristled at the implication that she could ever forget. Now, she wasn't so sure.

As she turned to head back to her friends, a glint in the sand caught her eye. Bending down, she picked up a small, iridescent shell. It was beautiful, yet imperfect – smooth on one side, rough and broken on the other. Adanna closed her fist around it, feeling its edges press into her palm.

She made her way back to the group, the shell nestled in her palm like a talisman. Her friends were packing up, their voices low and drowsy. Chioma looked up as Adanna approached, her eyes softening with concern.

"You okay, Ada?" she asked, using the childhood nickname that Adanna had all but forgotten.

Adanna nodded, surprising herself with the truth of it. "I think I am," she said softly.

As they walked back towards the city, the first hints of dawn streaking the sky, Adanna felt a shift within herself. The regret that had been building all night began to dissolve, replaced by a tentative hope. Perhaps she didn't have to choose between her two worlds. Perhaps, like the shell in her hand, she could be both smooth and rough, polished and raw.

She looked at her friends, at the familiar skyline of Lagos in the distance, and for the first time in years, felt truly at home. Tomorrow, she would call her mother. But for now, she savored the moment – the taste of salt on her lips, the warmth of the rising sun, and the promise of a new day.
