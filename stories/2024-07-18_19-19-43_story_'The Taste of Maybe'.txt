The Taste of Maybe

a story by Claude about the Midwest, self-consciousness, kissing, ambivalence, and regret

Ellie stood in the corner of the cramped off-campus apartment, clutching a red Solo cup filled with lukewarm beer she had no intention of drinking. The late August heat clung to her skin, making her sundress feel like a mistakeâ€”too casual, too young. She watched her classmates mingle effortlessly, their laughter punctuating the thrum of indie rock floating from someone's Bluetooth speaker. A familiar ache of not-quite-belonging settled in her chest, a sensation she'd hoped would have faded by junior year. But here she was, still the girl from small-town Ohio, pretending she knew how to navigate this world of collegiate ease and understated ambition.

She took a sip of her beer, grimacing at the taste, and let her mind wander to earlier that day. The local coffee shop had been buzzing with returning students when she'd bumped into Jake. His familiar grin had caught her off guard, a reminder of home that felt both comforting and unsettling.

"Ellie? Is that you?" he'd said, his voice a mix of surprise and warmth.

She'd fumbled with her iced latte, nearly spilling it. "Jake! What are you doing here?"

"Visiting my cousin for the weekend. I didn't know you went to school here."

Their conversation had been a staccato of half-finished sentences and nervous laughter, punctuated by long pauses filled with unspoken questions. Jake had mentioned a party later, casually inviting her as if they were still in high school, hanging out at the lake on Friday nights.

Now, scanning the crowded room, Ellie wondered if he'd actually show up. She tugged at the hem of her dress, second-guessing her choice for the hundredth time. Everyone else looked so put-together, so sure of themselves. She felt like a fraud, playing at being a college student while still feeling like the awkward teenager who'd left Lima two years ago.

Her roommate, Becca, appeared at her elbow. "You look like you're having the time of your life," she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm.

Ellie forced a smile. "Just taking it all in."

"Well, take it in closer to the action. Come on, I'll introduce you to some people from my Poli Sci class."

As Becca led her towards a group of students engaged in animated conversation, Ellie caught a glimpse of a familiar profile entering the apartment. Jake had come after all. Her heart did a little flip, equal parts excitement and dread.

He spotted her almost immediately, his face lighting up with recognition. As he made his way over, Ellie felt herself shrinking, wanting to disappear into the peeling wallpaper behind her.

"Hey, you made it," Jake said, his easy smile a stark contrast to the nervous energy thrumming through her body.

"Yeah, I, uh, live just down the street," she replied, immediately kicking herself for such a mundane response.

They fell into conversation, the background noise of the party fading as they reminisced about shared memories and mutual friends from home. Ellie found herself relaxing, slipping into the comfort of their shared history.

"Want to get some air?" Jake asked after a while, gesturing towards the small balcony.

Ellie nodded, following him through the sliding glass door into the warm Ohio night. The sounds of the party became muffled, replaced by the gentle rustling of leaves and distant traffic.

They stood in silence for a moment, looking out over the darkened campus. Ellie was acutely aware of Jake's presence beside her, the scent of his cologne mingling with the summer air.

"So, how's college treating you?" Jake asked, turning to face her.

Ellie hesitated, weighing her words. "It's... different. Good, mostly. Sometimes I feel like I'm still trying to figure out where I fit."

Jake nodded, understanding in his eyes. "Yeah, I get that. Sometimes I wonder if we ever really figure it out, you know?"

Their eyes met, and Ellie felt a charge in the air, a shift in the atmosphere between them. Jake leaned in slightly, his intention clear. Ellie's mind raced, a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions.

When their lips met, it was soft and hesitant at first. Ellie found herself responding, swept up in the moment, in the familiarity of Jake and the novelty of this new connection. But as quickly as it had begun, doubt crept in. She pulled back, her cheeks flushing.

"I'm sorry," Jake said, looking as confused as she felt. "I thought... Was that okay?"

Ellie struggled to find the right words. "It's not... I mean, it was nice, but..."

"But?"

She sighed, running a hand through her hair. "I don't know, Jake. We're in different places now, literally and figuratively. I'm still trying to figure out who I am here."

Jake nodded slowly, disappointment and understanding warring on his face

They stood in awkward silence for a moment before Jake spoke again. "I get it. I didn't mean to complicate things. It's just... seeing you again, it brought back a lot of memories."

Ellie nodded, relief and regret mingling in her chest. "Maybe we should head back inside," she suggested, already reaching for the door handle.

The party seemed louder now, more chaotic. Ellie and Jake drifted apart, each gravitating towards different groups. She caught his eye once across the room, exchanging a small, sad smile before turning away.

Later that night, Ellie lay in her narrow dorm bed, replaying the evening in her mind. The kiss lingered on her lips, a bittersweet reminder of what might have been. She thought about Jake, probably driving back to his own college by now, and wondered if he was thinking of her too.

Part of her wished she'd responded differently, let herself get swept up in the romance of reconnecting with an old friend. But another part, the part that had been slowly growing since she'd arrived at college, knew she'd made the right choice.

As she drifted off to sleep, Ellie realized that maybe this was what growing up felt like: a series of small decisions, each one shaping the person she was becoming. The taste of maybe, of paths not taken, was bittersweet on her tongue. But beneath it all was a quiet certainty that she was, slowly but surely, finding her way.
