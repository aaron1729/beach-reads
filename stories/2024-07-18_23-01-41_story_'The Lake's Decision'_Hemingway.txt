The Lake's Decision

a story by Claude about kissing, the Midwest, ambivalence, swimsuits, and privilege

The dock creaked under Sarah's weight as she sat, her legs dangling over the edge. The water was cool against her feet. She looked down at her new swimsuit, the fabric smooth and expensive against her skin. The lake stretched out before her, still and blue in the heavy summer heat. A breeze rustled through the trees, but brought no relief. She heard footsteps on the gravel path behind her.

Jake appeared, carrying a rake and pruning shears. His skin was tanned, his arms muscled from outdoor work. He nodded at Sarah.

"Miss," he said.

"Jake," she replied. "It's hot today."

He grunted in agreement, wiping sweat from his brow with a calloused hand.

"Join me?" Sarah patted the dock beside her.

Jake hesitated, glancing back at the big house on the hill. Then he set down his tools and sat, leaving a careful distance between them.

The silence stretched, filled only by the lap of water against the shore and the buzz of cicadas. Sarah watched a dragonfly skim across the lake's surface.

"How long have you worked here?" she asked.

"Three summers now," Jake said.

Sarah nodded. She'd seen him around the property, always at a distance. Always working.

"Do you like it? The job, I mean."

Jake shrugged. "It's work. Pays the bills."

Sarah felt a twinge of guilt. She'd never had to worry about bills.

"I used to come here every summer as a kid," Sarah said. "We'd swim all day. Build sandcastles. Roast marshmallows at night."

Jake nodded. "Sounds nice."

"It was." Sarah paused. "What about you? Grow up around here?"

"Born and raised. Never left." Jake's voice was flat, but Sarah sensed something beneath the surface. Pride, maybe. Or resentment.

She looked at him, really looked at him for the first time. His profile was strong, jaw set. His eyes, when they met hers, were a startling blue.

"Must be nice," she said. "To have roots."

Jake's eyebrow lifted slightly. "You don't?"

Sarah laughed, but there was no humor in it. "I've lived in five different cities in the past three years. My parents are always chasing the next big thing."

"And you?"

"I'm..." Sarah hesitated. "I'm not sure what I'm chasing."

The admission hung in the air between them. Sarah felt exposed, vulnerable. She hadn't meant to reveal so much.

Jake said nothing, but he shifted slightly closer.

The sun beat down, relentless. Sweat beaded on Sarah's upper lip. She watched a drop fall from her chin, rippling the water's surface.

"Sometimes I think about staying," she said softly. "Just... not going back."

Jake turned to her, his eyes searching her face. "Why don't you?"

Sarah shrugged, feeling the weight of expectations, of her family's legacy. "It's not that simple."

"Isn't it?"

Their eyes met. Sarah felt a pull, like gravity. She leaned in, barely breathing.

Jake closed the distance. His lips were soft, surprising. The kiss was brief, electric.

They broke apart. Sarah's heart raced. Jake's cheeks were flushed, his eyes wide.

For a moment, neither spoke. The world had shrunk to just this dock, just them.

Then reality crashed back. Sarah touched her lips, stunned. Jake stood abruptly, grabbing his tools.

"I should go," he said, voice rough.

Sarah nodded, unable to speak. She watched him walk away, his figure blurring as tears filled her eyes.

Sarah sat on the dock until the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the lake. The water had turned from blue to gold, then to deep orange. She watched the colors change, feeling the weight of the day settle on her shoulders.

She thought about Jake, about the kiss. It had been impulsive, unexpected. But it had felt real in a way few things in her life did.

As darkness fell, Sarah stood. Her legs were stiff from sitting so long. She walked slowly back to the house, each step a decision. The gravel crunched under her bare feet.

The big house loomed ahead, windows glowing with warm light. Inside, she knew, her parents would be waiting. There would be plans to discuss, expectations to meet. A life mapped out for her.

Sarah paused at the edge of the lawn, looking back at the lake. In the twilight, she could just make out the outline of the dock. She touched her lips, remembering.

Then she turned and walked into the house, leaving wet footprints on the polished floor.

The next morning, Sarah woke early. The house was quiet. She slipped out, still in her pajamas, and headed for the lake.

The grass was wet with dew. Mist hung over the water. She stood at the edge of the dock, watching the sun rise.

She heard footsteps behind her. Jake. He stood a few feet away, hands in his pockets.

"Morning," he said.

"Morning," she replied.

They were silent for a moment. Then Jake spoke.

"About yesterdayâ€”"

"It's okay," Sarah interrupted. "We don't have to talk about it."

Jake nodded. He looked out over the lake.

"I'm leaving today," Sarah said softly.

Jake turned to her, surprise in his eyes. "Leaving?"

Sarah nodded. "Back to the city. Back to... everything."

"I see," Jake said. His voice was neutral, but Sarah saw his jaw clench.

She took a deep breath. "Unless..."

Jake looked at her, waiting.

"Unless I don't," Sarah finished.

Jake's eyes widened. "What are you saying?"

Sarah took a step closer. "I'm saying... maybe I stay. Maybe I find out what it's like to have roots."

Jake was silent for a long moment. Then he reached out, took her hand.

"It won't be easy," he said.

Sarah nodded. "I know."

The sun was fully up now, burning away the mist. The lake shimmered, a new day unfolding.

"So," Jake said, a small smile playing on his lips. "What now?"

Sarah squeezed his hand. "Now," she said, "we jump."

And together, they leapt into the cool, clear water.
