Sunburnt Desires: A Suburban Odyssey

a story by Claude about self-consciousness, lust, cookouts, sunscreen, and sweat

Vexing Helios, that celestial voyeur, had once again trained his unblinking gaze upon our humble cul-de-sac, transforming the Johnsons' backyard into a Hadean realm of sizzling meats and glistening epidermises. I, Humbert Humble (no relation), found myself marooned in this suburban Gehenna, a reluctant Virgil among the flip-flop-shod denizens of our little neighborhood inferno. The air, thick with the perfume of charred flesh and coconut-scented UV shields, clung to my skin like the regrets of yesteryear, each breath a laborious exchange between my withering lungs and the miasma of conviviality that threatened to suffocate my very soul.

As I navigated the treacherous terrain of lawn chairs and coolers, my eyes alighted upon her—Venus incarnate, rising not from the foam of the sea but from a chartreuse chaise longue. Her sundress, a gossamer confection of white cotton, clung to her form with a devotion I could only envy. Lola—for that was her name, a verbal bonbon I savored each time it crossed my lips—was the Johnsons' niece, a college student home for the summer, and the unwitting tormentor of my middle-aged fantasies.

"Humbert!" bellowed Bob Johnson, his face as red and round as the tomato he was desecrating with a dull knife. "Grab yourself a brew and get over here!" I obliged, my feet carrying me towards the grill while my traitorous gaze remained fixed on Lola's supple form. She stretched, catlike, and reached for her bottle of sunscreen.

Oh, to be that plastic vessel, to dispense my essence upon her sun-kissed skin! Instead, I found myself fumbling with a sweating can of domestic lager, its contents as insipid as the conversation that awaited me by the Weber shrine where Bob held court.

As I approached, I became acutely aware of my own pallid, paunchy physique—a stark contrast to the bronzed and toned specimens that populated this backyard bacchanal. My skin, unused to such solar assault, was already beginning to prickle and burn. I realized, with a mixture of dread and resignation, that I would need to perform the ritual of self-anointing if I were to survive this afternoon without metamorphosing into a crustacean caricature of myself.

With a muttered excuse to Bob, who was now expounding on the virtues of propane versus charcoal, I retreated to a secluded corner of the yard. There, I engaged in what can only be described as a solar salsa of shame—a contortionist's nightmare as I attempted to apply sunscreen to my own back. My arms, suddenly elastic and uncooperative, flailed like the tentacles of some landlocked cephalopod. I twisted and turned, grunting softly with effort, the cool lotion providing momentary relief to my overheated skin.

"Need some help with that?"

The voice, melodious and amused, froze me mid-writhe. I turned, slowly, to find Lola standing mere inches away, a bemused smile playing on her lips. Up close, I could see the constellation of freckles across her nose, each one a tiny sun mocking my pallid complexion.

"I... that is... well," I stammered, my usual linguistic dexterity deserting me in my hour of need. Lola, taking pity on my incoherence, plucked the bottle from my hand.

"Turn around," she commanded, and I obeyed, my heart thrumming like a hummingbird's wings. Her hands, cool and soft, began to spread the lotion across my shoulders. Each touch was electric, sending shivers down my spine despite the oppressive heat.

"There," Lola said, patting my back with a finality that signaled both the completion of her task and the zenith of my afternoon. "All protected now."

I turned to face her, my mouth dry, searching for words that would prolong this moment, this unexpected intimacy. But before I could formulate a response that wouldn't reveal the tempest of my thoughts, Bob's voice boomed across the yard.

"Burgers are ready! Come and get 'em!"

The spell broken, Lola flashed me a smile and sauntered towards the grill, leaving me to trail behind like a lost puppy, still tingling from her touch. The assembled guests converged on Bob's culinary offerings with the enthusiasm of seagulls descending on an unattended picnic. I found myself swept along in the tide of hungry suburbanites, a paper plate thrust into my hands.

As I reached for the condiments, my fingers brushed against Lola's once more. She was reaching for the mustard, that piquant yellow substance that suddenly seemed the most important thing in the universe. Our eyes met, and for a moment, I fancied I saw a flicker of... something. Interest? Amusement? Pity? Whatever it was, it vanished as quickly as it appeared, leaving me to wonder if it had been merely a mirage, a heat-induced hallucination.

Lost in this reverie, I failed to notice the precarious tilt of the lemonade pitcher as I reached for it. In a moment of cinematic slow-motion, I watched in horror as my elbow connected with the sweating glass container. It toppled, unleashing a tidal wave of sugary citrus across the table and onto my khakis.

A chorus of gasps and titters erupted around me. I stood there, dripping and mortified, a suburban Poseidon risen from a sea of Country Time. Lola, bless her, sprang into action, grabbing a handful of napkins and dabbing at my soaked shirt.

"Oh, Humbert," she laughed, her eyes twinkling with mirth rather than malice, "you do know how to make a splash at a party."

As I stammered apologies and attempted to help clean up the mess, I caught my reflection in the mirrored surface of the grill lid. There I was, a middle-aged man, soaked in lemonade, being tended to by a goddess half my age. The absurdity of the situation struck me, and I found myself laughing along with Lola, our shared mirth a balm to my wounded pride.

In that moment, sticky and ridiculous, I realized the folly of my earlier lustful thoughts. Lola was kind, yes, but she was also young, vibrant, with a life stretching before her like an endless summer day. And I? I was simply another guest at a cookout, marinating in the brine of my own folly.

As the laughter subsided and the mess was cleaned, I found myself drifting to the periphery of the gathering. The sun, now lower in the sky, cast long shadows across the lawn. I watched as Lola rejoined her peers, her laughter carrying on the warm evening air.

Bob approached, offering me a fresh drink and a sympathetic clap on the shoulder. "Don't sweat it, Humbert," he said. "We've all been there."

I nodded, grateful for his kindness, and took a sip of the cold beer. As the day's heat began to dissipate, so too did my earlier discomfort. I realized that while I might not be the dashing figure I once imagined myself to be, I was still a part of this community, this moment.

The cookout continued around me, a tableau of suburban life in all its mundane glory. And as I stood there, slightly damp but no longer burning, I felt a sense of peace settle over me. The longing remained, a bittersweet ache, but it was tempered now by acceptance and a touch of self-deprecating humor.

After all, in the grand comedy of life, aren't we all just bit players, desperately trying not to spill the lemonade?
