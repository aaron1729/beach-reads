The Weight of Paradise

a story by Claude about regret, privilege, self-consciousness, ambivalence, and ennui

Amelia stretched out on her sun lounger, the pristine white sand cool beneath her feet despite the Caribbean sun beating down. She'd chosen this particular spot—far enough from the resort's main hub to avoid the chatter of other guests, yet close enough to catch the eye of a wandering waiter should she desire another daiquiri. The turquoise sea lapped gently at the shore, a postcard-perfect scene that should have instilled a sense of bliss. Instead, Amelia found herself oddly untethered, as if the idyllic surroundings were a elaborate stage set, and she an reluctant actor who'd forgotten her lines. She closed her eyes behind oversized sunglasses, allowing the gentle breeze to caress her skin, and wondered why paradise felt so much like purgatory.

The memory of her decision to embark on this solo adventure flickered through her mind like an old film reel. London had become a labyrinth of expectations and half-formed ambitions, each street corner a reminder of paths not taken. Her flat in Primrose Hill, once a symbol of her success, now felt like a gilded cage. The idea of escape had germinated slowly, nurtured by late-night glasses of wine and aimless scrolling through travel websites.

"You need a break, darling," her mother had said, concern etched in the lines around her eyes. "Go somewhere warm, somewhere you can think."

But thinking, Amelia was beginning to realize, was precisely the problem. Here, surrounded by beauty so stark it bordered on the surreal, her thoughts seemed to spiral with even greater intensity. She sat up, pushing her sunglasses onto her head, and surveyed the beach. A few meters away, a resort employee was raking the sand, erasing all evidence of earlier beachgoers. His movements were methodical, almost meditative, and Amelia found herself envying the simplicity of his task.

As if sensing her gaze, the man looked up, offering a polite smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. Amelia felt a familiar twinge of discomfort, a sensation she'd been grappling with since her arrival. It was the same feeling she'd experienced during her childhood visits to her father's family in Jamaica—a sense of being simultaneously insider and outsider, belonging everywhere and nowhere.

She stood, brushing sand from her designer swimsuit, and made her way towards the bar. The wooden structure, with its thatched roof and colorful stools, was like a set piece from a tourist's fantasy of island life. Behind the counter stood Jerome, his smile genuine as he greeted her.

"The usual, Miss Amelia?" he asked, already reaching for the rum.

"Please," she nodded, settling onto a stool. "And Jerome, I've told you, just Amelia is fine."

He chuckled, a warm sound that seemed to cut through her malaise. "Old habits, Miss- I mean, Amelia. You British and your formalities, you know?"

As he mixed her drink, Amelia found herself studying him. His ease, his apparent contentment, fascinated her. "Jerome," she began, then hesitated. "Do you ever... I mean, working here, do you ever feel..."

"Like I'm on permanent vacation?" he finished, sliding her daiquiri across the bar. "Not really. It's a job, you know? A good one, sure, but still a job."

Amelia sipped her drink, mulling over his words. The sweetness of the rum clashed with the bitterness rising in her throat. Here she was, privileged enough to be bored by paradise, while Jerome saw it as nothing more than a workplace.

The tranquil atmosphere was suddenly shattered by raucous laughter. Amelia turned to see a group of sunburnt tourists stumbling towards the bar, their accents unmistakably British. She felt a flush of embarrassment, as if their behavior somehow reflected on her.

"Oi, mate!" one of them called out to Jerome. "Six piña coladas, and make 'em strong!"

Jerome's smile remained fixed, but Amelia noticed a slight tension in his shoulders as he began preparing the drinks. She wanted to apologize, to distance herself from her countrymen, but the words stuck in her throat.

As the group's chatter filled the air, Amelia found herself shrinking inward. Their voices, loud and unabashed, seemed to underscore her own sense of displacement. She was neither tourist nor local, neither fully white nor fully black. In London, she'd cultivated an identity around this in-betweenness, wearing it like a badge of cultural sophistication. Here, it felt more like a void.

"Everything alright?" Jerome's voice cut through her reverie. She realized she'd been staring blankly at her half-empty glass.

"Yes, I'm fine," she replied automatically, then paused. "Actually, no. I'm not sure I am."

Jerome raised an eyebrow, inviting her to continue, but at that moment, a commotion erupted behind them.

One of the British tourists had knocked over a tray of glasses, sending shards of glass skittering across the wooden deck. The man responsible, red-faced and swaying, was arguing loudly with a young local staff member who had rushed to clean up the mess.

"Watch where you're going, you clumsy idiot!" the tourist bellowed, his words slurring.

Amelia felt her chest tighten. She glanced at Jerome, whose easy smile had vanished, replaced by a carefully neutral expression. The young staff member murmured apologies as he swept up the glass, his eyes downcast.

In that moment, Amelia saw the invisible lines that crisscrossed the resort, separating guest from staff, tourist from local, privilege from servitude. She stood up abruptly, her chair scraping loudly against the floor.

"That's enough," she said, her voice shaking slightly. "It was clearly an accident. You should apologize."

The tourist turned to her, surprise morphing into belligerence. "Mind your own business, love," he sneered.

Amelia felt a familiar paralysis creeping over her, the fear of confrontation warring with her sense of injustice. She looked at Jerome, hoping for support, but his face remained impassive. Of course, she realized. He couldn't risk his job by getting involved.

The moment passed. The tourist's friends ushered him away, muttering apologies. The young staff member finished cleaning and disappeared. Amelia sank back onto her stool, a wave of shame washing over her. She'd wanted to do more, say more, but found herself paralyzed by her own conflicted identity.

As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the beach, Amelia looked at Jerome. "I'm sorry," she said softly, though for what exactly, she wasn't sure.

Jerome's smile returned, tinged with something like understanding. "It's okay, Amelia. That's just how it is sometimes."

She nodded, gathering her things. As she walked away, Amelia realized that her week in paradise had taught her more about herself than she'd bargained for. The regret and ambivalence she'd tried to escape had followed her here, but now, at least, she understood them a little better.
