Sunscreen for the Soul

a story by Claude about ennui, beer, ambivalence, self-consciousness, and sunscreen

The sun, that fiery ball of celestial ambivalence, glared down upon Chowpatty Beach with all the ferocity of a Bollywood villain, its rays piercing the ozone layer's diminishing armor like the pointed barbs of a critic's tongue. Ravi Patel, his middle-aged paunch straining against the confines of a garishly patterned Hawaiian shirt (oh, the sartorial ironies of vacation!), found himself marooned on a towel that had seen better days, much like his own sagging spirit. The sand, a glittering expanse of crushed dreams and pulverized seashells, stretched before him in an endless taunt of leisure he felt wholly unequipped to embrace. As he fumbled with a bottle of sunscreen—SPF 50, because melanin be damned, he wasn't taking any chances—Ravi couldn't shake the feeling that he was but a misplaced comma in the run-on sentence of life, pausing awkwardly where he didn't belong.

Ravi squinted at the label on the sunscreen bottle, its promise of "Total Protection" mocking his existential vulnerability. With a sigh that carried the weight of a thousand unanswered emails, he began to slather the white goop onto his arms, watching it disappear into his skin like the years had vanished from his life. As he worked, a curious sensation began to creep over him, starting as a tingle in his fingertips and spreading like wildfire through his nerves.

Suddenly, the beach around him exploded into a cacophony of inner voices. The plump aunty to his left, resplendent in her floral swimsuit, was mentally berating her husband for forgetting to pack the samosas. A group of college students nearby were collectively panicking about their upcoming exams, their anxieties mixing with the scent of coconut oil and sweat. Ravi's eyes widened in disbelief. Had the sun finally addled his brain, or was this sunscreen doing more than just preventing UV damage?

As he grappled with this new-found ability, a wiry chaiwallah appeared, as if conjured from the haze of heat shimmering above the sand. "Chai, sahib? Or perhaps something stronger to quench your thirst?" The man winked, producing a frosty bottle of beer from his cart with the flourish of a magician. Ravi, his throat suddenly parched from the onslaught of mental voices, nodded gratefully and accepted the drink.

The beer, cold and crisp, slid down Ravi's throat like liquid enlightenment. As the amber nectar hit his stomach, the world around him began to shimmer and warp, reality bending like a Dalí painting left out in the Mumbai heat. The beachgoers' thoughts, once a mere whisper in his mind, now exploded into vivid, swirling visions.

The aunty's memories of her wedding day danced before his eyes, saris twirling in a kaleidoscope of colors. The college students' futures unfurled like a Bollywood film reel, frames jumping between success and failure, love and heartbreak. Ravi watched, mesmerized, as a portly businessman nearby transformed into a glittering peacock, his tailfeathers a fan of rupee notes and stock certificates.

Amidst this phantasmagoria, Ravi's own life began to unspool. He saw himself as a young boy, full of dreams and wonder, metamorphosing into the man he'd become – a middle-manager trapped in a chrysalis of spreadsheets and performance reviews. But there, shimmering on the horizon of possibility, he glimpsed another version of himself: an author, penning stories that bridged worlds and cultures, weaving tales as intricate as the patterns on a Kashmiri shawl.

As the visions swirled around him, Ravi felt a sudden urge to write. He fumbled in his beach bag, past the forgotten novel he'd brought to read, and found a crumpled receipt and a stubby pencil. His hand moved of its own accord, scribbling furiously as the stories of the beach unfolded before him.

He wrote of the chaiwallah, whose cart was a portal to other dimensions, serving drinks that could alter reality. He penned tales of the sea, whispering secrets of ancient civilizations to those who dared to listen. The sunbathers became characters in an epic saga, their mundane lives transformed into extraordinary adventures.

As Ravi wrote, he felt the weight of his ennui lifting, replaced by a lightness he hadn't experienced since childhood. The words flowed like the waves lapping at the shore, each sentence a revelation, each paragraph a rebirth. He was so engrossed in his writing that he didn't notice the sun beginning to set, painting the sky in hues that would make even the most jaded Bollywood art director weep with joy.

It was only when the chaiwallah gently tapped his shoulder that Ravi looked up, blinking in confusion at the now-empty beach. "Time to go home, sahib," the old man said with a knowing smile. "But perhaps you've found a new home in your words, no?"

Ravi nodded, a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. He gathered his belongings, the crumpled receipt now a treasure map to his new self. As he stood, he noticed the sunscreen bottle lying forgotten in the sand. He picked it up, turning it over in his hands. The label now read, "Total Transformation: Apply liberally to unleash your inner storyteller."

With a chuckle, Ravi tucked the bottle into his bag. The beach was quiet now, save for the gentle lapping of waves and the distant honking of Mumbai traffic. As he walked towards the city lights, his mind buzzed with possibilities. The ennui that had weighed him down now felt like a distant memory, replaced by a burning desire to capture the magic he'd experienced.

He paused at the edge of the beach, looking back at the darkening sea. The moon rose, a perfect circle of possibility, its reflection dancing on the water like words on a page. Ravi took a deep breath, tasting salt and potential on his tongue. Tomorrow, he decided, he would return to his office cubicle, but not as the same man who had left it. He would carry this beach, this magic, this newfound purpose within him.
