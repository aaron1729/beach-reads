Saltwater Memories

a story by Claude about sunscreen, kissing, ambivalence, cookouts, and sand

The sun beat down mercilessly, turning the sand into a scorching blanket that seared Zora's feet as she stepped onto the familiar shore. The air was thick with the cloying scent of coconut sunscreen, mingling with the briny tang of the sea and the smoky aroma of distant barbecues. Zora closed her eyes, letting the symphony of crashing waves and children's laughter wash over her, a cacophony that transported her back through the years. The beach had always been a place of memory for her, each grain of sand holding a fragment of her past â€“ some sweet, some bitter, all a part of her. As she opened her eyes, squinting against the glare, she saw her family in the distance, already gathered around the grill, their voices carried on the warm breeze. Zora hesitated, her heart heavy with an ambivalence she couldn't quite name, caught between the pull of tradition and the push of her own desires.

Zora's feet moved of their own accord, carrying her towards the gathering. With each step, memories bubbled up like air pockets in wet sand. She remembered the first time her mother had slathered her in sunscreen, the cool lotion a stark contrast to her sun-warmed skin. The scent had made her sneeze, and her mother had laughed, a sound as rare and precious as the sea glass they'd collect together.

As she drew closer, Zora could make out individual faces. Aunt Bessie, her ample form casting a wide shadow as she fanned herself with a paper plate. Uncle Jeremiah, tending the grill with the seriousness of a man performing sacred rites. And there, perched on a colorful beach towel, was her cousin Lily, now a woman grown but still wearing the same mischievous grin she'd had as a child.

Lily spotted her first, waving enthusiastically. "Zora! You made it!" The words carried across the beach, causing heads to turn. Zora felt the weight of their gazes, a mix of welcome and curiosity. She hadn't been to a family cookout in years, not since...

The thought trailed off as a gust of wind kicked up, sending grains of sand skittering across her legs. She brushed them away, the rough texture beneath her palms grounding her in the present. This was now, not then. She was here, flesh and blood, not a ghost of summers past.

Zora plastered on a smile and approached the group. Hugs were exchanged, kisses pressed to cheeks, hands patting her back with varying degrees of force. The familiarity of it all was both comforting and suffocating.

"Girl, you're so thin!" Aunt Bessie exclaimed, pushing a plate loaded with food into her hands. "Eat, eat!"

Zora glanced down at the pile of potato salad, coleslaw, and barbecued chicken. The sight and smell transported her instantly to summers long past, when she'd devoured such plates with carefree abandon. Now, her stomach churned with a mix of hunger and apprehension.

She found a spot on the edge of the gathering, close enough to be part of it but far enough to observe. As she picked at her food, her gaze drifted to the shoreline where children played. A little boy, no more than five or six, was meticulously building a sandcastle. His small hands patted and smoothed, creating turrets and walls with intense concentration.

Zora watched, transfixed, as the boy worked. She saw herself in him, remembered the hours she'd spent shaping sand into fantastical creations. How proud she'd been of each castle, how devastated when the tide inevitably washed them away.

A commotion from the grill drew her attention. Uncle Jeremiah was regaling the family with a story, his booming voice carrying over the sound of sizzling meat and laughter. Zora caught fragments - something about a fishing trip gone wrong, a boat nearly capsized. The others hung on his every word, but Zora found her gaze drawn back to the boy and his sandcastle.

As the sun began its descent, casting long shadows across the beach, Zora felt a presence beside her. It was Lily, her smile softer now, tinged with concern.

"You okay, cuz?" Lily asked, bumping Zora's shoulder gently with her own.

Zora nodded, not trusting her voice. Lily didn't push, just sat there in companionable silence. After a while, she spoke again, her voice low and conspiratorial.

"Remember that summer when we snuck out to meet those boys from the boardwalk?"

The memory hit Zora like a wave, sudden and overwhelming. She'd been fifteen, Lily sixteen. They'd giggled and whispered as they crept away from the sleeping house, hearts pounding with excitement and fear.

"That was my first kiss," Zora murmured, surprised to hear the words aloud.

Lily laughed softly. "Mine too. God, we were so awkward. All sunburned and sticky with sunscreen."

Zora closed her eyes, remembering. The boy's lips had been chapped, tasting of salt and cherry cola. She'd been so nervous, so unsure of where to put her hands, what to do with her tongue. It had been messy and imperfect and wonderful.

When she opened her eyes, she found Lily watching her, a knowing look in her eyes.

"It's okay to miss it, you know," Lily said softly. "The past. But don't let it keep you from the present."

Zora nodded, a lump forming in her throat. She looked out at the ocean, its colors shifting as the sun sank lower on the horizon. The boy with the sandcastle was gone, his creation left to the mercy of the incoming tide.

As if reading her thoughts, Lily stood and held out her hand. "Come on," she said, "let's go for a walk."

They strolled along the water's edge, letting the cool waves lap at their feet. The sounds of the family cookout faded behind them, replaced by the rhythmic crash of waves and the cry of seagulls.

"I've missed this," Zora admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. "Missed you all. I just... after Mom..."

Lily squeezed her hand. "We've missed you too. And we understand."

They stopped, watching as the sun finally dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in brilliant oranges and pinks. Zora felt something shift inside her, like sand resettling after a storm.

"Maybe," she said slowly, "maybe it's time to come back."

Lily smiled, and together they turned back towards the family gathering, their footprints in the sand soon to be washed away by the tide, but the memory of this moment etched permanently in their hearts.
