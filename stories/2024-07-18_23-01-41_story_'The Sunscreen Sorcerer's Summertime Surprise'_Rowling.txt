The Sunscreen Sorcerer's Summertime Surprise

a story by Claude about sunscreen, the Midwest, sand, cookouts, and self-consciousness

Midge Middleton stood at the edge of Lake Shimmer, her toes sinking into sand that whispered secrets with each step. The hidden beach, nestled in the heart of Iowa's corn country, sparkled with a magic that made the Midwest feel as exotic as any faraway shore. Clutching her wand in one freckled hand and a bottle of Madame Mirage's Mood-Matching Sunscreen in the other, Midge took a deep breath of the warm, sweet air. The scent of grilling hot dogs mingled with the aroma of blooming cloudberries, creating a uniquely magical summer fragrance. As she gazed at the shimmering water, Midge couldn't shake the feeling that this year's Great Wizard Cookout would be unlike any other.

Midge smoothed her oversized t-shirt, a hand-me-down from her older brother that read "I Survived the Great Pixie Invasion of '98," and sighed. She'd always felt out of place at these summer gatherings, her pale skin and ginger hair standing out among the sun-kissed witches and wizards. But this year would be different, she told herself. This year, she had Madame Mirage's miracle sunscreen.

"Midge! Over here!" called a familiar voice. Gus Grillmaster waved enthusiastically from a few yards away, his wand tucked behind his ear and a "Kiss the Cook (At Your Own Risk)" apron flapping in the breeze. Beside him, Faye Fairweather lounged on a levitating beach chair, her nose buried in "Charms for Sandy Situations: A Beachgoer's Guide."

As Midge approached her friends, the sand beneath her feet began to hum a cheerful tune. She grinned, momentarily forgetting her nervousness. That was the thing about Lake Shimmer – it always had a way of surprising you, even when you thought you'd seen it all.

"Ready for the cookout?" Gus asked, gesturing proudly to his elaborate grill setup. It looked more like a Rube Goldberg machine than a cooking apparatus, with tubes and gears protruding at odd angles. "This year, I've enchanted it to flip the burgers automatically. No more singed eyebrows for me!"

Faye lowered her book, eyeing the contraption skeptically. "Just promise me you won't set the beach on fire again. I'm still finding bits of glass in my hair from last year's sand-to-crystal mishap."

Midge chuckled at her friends' banter, but her laughter faded as she remembered the sunscreen in her hand. "Um, guys? I was thinking of trying this new sunscreen. Do you think it's a good idea?"

Gus squinted at the bottle. "Mood-Matching, eh? Sounds interesting. Give it a go!"

With a deep breath, Midge squeezed a dollop onto her palm and began to apply it. At first, nothing happened. Then, slowly, her skin began to change color. But instead of the sun-kissed glow she'd hoped for, Midge watched in horror as her arms turned a vivid shade of blue.

"Oh no," she whispered, looking down at her azure hands. "What's happening?"

Faye leapt from her chair, book forgotten. "Midge, are you feeling blue?"

"I wasn't until now!" Midge cried, her skin darkening to a deep navy.

Just then, a booming voice echoed across the beach. "Witches and wizards, welcome to the Annual Great Wizard Cookout!"

Midge's eyes widened in panic. "Quick, hide me!" she pleaded, diving behind Gus's monstrous grill.

As wizards and witches began to gather around, Gus attempted to distract them. "Who's ready for some magically delicious burgers?" he announced, waving his wand at the grill. Sparks flew, and suddenly, the contraption sprang to life, flipping patties and squirting condiments with wild abandon.

Meanwhile, Faye crouched beside Midge. "It's okay," she whispered. "Maybe we can reverse it. What were you thinking when you applied the sunscreen?"

Midge bit her lip. "I was worried about fitting in, about standing out too much."

Faye's eyes lit up. "That's it! The sunscreen is reflecting your fears. You need to change your thoughts to change your color."

As if on cue, a glob of ketchup arced through the air, splattering across Midge's blue arm. She stared at it, then burst into giggles. "I guess I really do stand out now, huh?"

To her amazement, where the laughter bubbled up, her skin began to fade back to its normal hue. Faye grinned. "That's it, Midge! Keep thinking happy thoughts!"

Emboldened, Midge stepped out from behind the grill, her skin a patchwork of blue and normal tones. The crowd turned to look, and for a moment, silence fell over the beach.

Then, a young wizard with curly hair and glasses stepped forward. "Wicked!" he exclaimed. "How'd you do that?"

Suddenly, everyone wanted to know about Midge's unique look. She found herself surrounded by curious faces, all asking questions and marveling at her color-changing skin.

"It's Madame Mirage's Mood-Matching Sunscreen," Midge explained, holding up the bottle. "It changes color based on how you feel."

The crowd oohed and aahed. An elderly witch with a seashell wand approached. "My dear, you've stumbled upon a marvelous party trick! Would you mind if I tried some?"

Before long, the beach was filled with witches and wizards in various hues, laughing and comparing colors. Gus's burgers, now a rainbow of flavors to match the colorful crowd, were a hit. The singing sand seemed to hum louder, as if enjoying the festive atmosphere.

As the sun began to set, casting a warm glow over Lake Shimmer, Midge found herself sitting between Faye and Gus, watching the multicolored partygoers. Her skin had settled into a soft, shimmering tan – the exact shade she'd originally hoped for.

"You know," she said, wiggling her toes in the sand, "I think this turned out to be the best cookout yet."

Faye nudged her shoulder. "See? You fit in perfectly, just by being yourself."

Gus nodded, flipping one last burger. "Plus, you've given everyone a new appreciation for standing out. Next year's cookout theme? 'The more colorful, the better!'"

As laughter echoed across the magical Midwestern beach, Midge smiled, realizing that sometimes, the best summers are the ones where you learn to embrace your true colors – quite literally.
