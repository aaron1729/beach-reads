The Perfume of Forgotten Summers

a story by Claude about bug spray, constipation, cookouts, sunscreen, and ennui

On the day Doña Soledad's constipation finally broke, ending forty years of intestinal solitude, the air hung heavy with the scent of roasting pork and the acrid sweetness of her great-granddaughter's sunscreen. The family had gathered, as they did every summer solstice, on the sun-bleached patio that jutted precariously over the restless Caribbean. They came armed with their usual arsenal: coolers filled with beer and coconut water, platters of sliced mango sprinkled with chili powder, and bottles of the family's secret bug spray—a concoction that smelled of mint and motor oil, and was said to repel not only mosquitoes but also bad luck and unwanted suitors. As Doña Soledad watched from her wicker throne, her gnarled fingers clutching a sweating glass of lemonade, she felt a familiar rumbling in her lower belly, a sensation she had not experienced since the summer her husband disappeared into the sea, leaving behind only a pair of salt-crusted flip-flops and the lingering scent of tobacco and regret.

Doña Soledad's great-granddaughter, Marisol, approached with a bottle of sunscreen, its plastic surface slick with condensation. "Abuela," she said, "let me protect you from the sun." The old woman nodded, her eyes fixed on the horizon where the sea met the sky in a shimmering mirage. As Marisol's hands glided over her papery skin, Doña Soledad felt a tingling sensation, as if the lotion were seeping into her very bones, awakening memories long dormant.

The air shimmered with heat, and the scent of grilling meat mingled with the salty breeze. Doña Soledad's son, Augusto, tended the grill with the solemn dedication of a priest performing a sacred ritual. His wife, Carmela, swatted at invisible mosquitoes, her movements becoming increasingly frantic as the day wore on.

"The bugs are worse this year," Carmela complained, reaching for the family's prized bug spray. As she misted herself with the pungent liquid, her outline seemed to blur, becoming indistinct against the backdrop of sea and sky. Doña Soledad blinked, unsure if the heat was playing tricks on her eyes or if her daughter-in-law was truly fading from view.

As the day wore on, a sense of ennui settled over the gathering like a fine mist. The children, once boisterous and full of life, now sprawled listlessly on beach towels, their eyes glazed with boredom. The adults sipped their drinks mechanically, conversations dwindling into long silences punctuated only by the rhythmic crash of waves against the shore.

It was in this moment of collective lethargy that a stranger appeared on the beach. He walked with purpose towards the family gathering, his crisp white linen suit unmarred by sand or sweat, his skin unblemished by sun or insect bites. As he drew closer, Doña Soledad felt a stirring in her gut, a sensation both familiar and foreign.

The stranger introduced himself as Esteban, a distant cousin no one could quite place in the family tree. He carried with him a small, ornate box, which he presented to Doña Soledad with a flourish. "A gift," he said, "to ease your troubles."

With trembling hands, Doña Soledad opened the box. Inside lay a single, iridescent pill that seemed to pulse with an inner light. Without hesitation, she swallowed it, feeling it slide down her throat and into her belly, where it settled like a warm stone.

The effect was immediate and extraordinary. Doña Soledad felt a great shifting within her, as if tectonic plates were realigning beneath her skin. The family watched in amazement as her wrinkles smoothed, her gray hair regained its youthful luster, and a rosy glow spread across her cheeks. She stood up from her wicker throne, stretching limbs that had been stiff for decades.

As Doña Soledad's transformation unfolded, the very air around the gathering seemed to change. The oppressive heat lifted, replaced by a cool breeze that carried with it the scent of jasmine and possibility. The children stirred from their lethargy, eyes bright with renewed wonder. The adults found themselves laughing, truly laughing, for the first time in years.

Esteban smiled enigmatically, his eyes twinkling with secrets untold. He turned to leave, but before he could take a step, Doña Soledad grasped his arm. "Stay," she said, her voice strong and clear. "Join us for the feast."

And so, as the sun began its descent towards the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, the family gathered around the table laden with steaming dishes. The pork, infused with the essence of their shared history, was more succulent than ever before. Conversation flowed like wine, stories intertwining and creating new legends with each retelling.

As night fell, fireflies emerged, their gentle glow mingling with the starlight. Doña Soledad, feeling a freedom she hadn't known in decades, led her family in a dance on the beach. Their feet left ephemeral patterns in the sand, telling stories of joy, loss, and renewal.

Esteban watched from the edge of the gathering, his presence both part of and apart from the celebration. As the moon rose, full and luminous, he quietly slipped away, leaving behind only a faint shimmer in the air where he had stood.

The family danced on, unaware of his departure. Marisol, twirling in the moonlight, suddenly gasped and pointed towards the sea. There, just beyond the breaking waves, they saw a figure that looked remarkably like Doña Soledad's long-lost husband, waving and smiling before disappearing beneath the surface.

As dawn broke, the family found themselves back on the patio, the night's magic fading like a dream. Yet something had fundamentally changed. The air of ennui had lifted, replaced by a sense of renewed purpose and connection.

Doña Soledad, once again in her wicker chair but sitting taller now, smiled at her family. "Every ending," she said, her eyes twinkling, "is just another beginning." And with those words, she felt the last of her constipation release, forty years of stagnation flowing away with the tide.
