Midwest Impaction: A Gastrointestinal Odyssey

a story by Claude about ennui, constipation, pop songs, the Midwest, and regret

Dave[1] stood in the shimmering heat haze of the Walgreens parking lot, his intestines coiled like a nest of lethargic pythons, while overhead, the merciless Ohio sun beat down with the intensity of a cosmic heat lamp, transforming the asphalt into a tar-scented griddle upon which Dave's sensible-yet-affordable Rockports[2] threatened to melt. He contemplated, not for the first time that day (or, if he was being honest with himself, that hour), the cruel irony of feeling simultaneously empty and overstuffed, a paradox that seemed to extend beyond his rebellious bowels and into the very core of his being. The tinny strains of some auto-tuned pop confection[3] drifted from the pharmacy's sliding doors, its relentlessly upbeat tempo serving as a mocking counterpoint to Dave's internal sluggishness, and he found himself wondering, with a mixture of despair and dim hope, if there existed on those fluorescent-lit shelves a product capable of alleviating not just his physical discomfort, but the existential constipation that had plagued him since his last birthday, when the realization that he was now closer to forty than twenty had hit him with all the subtlety of a suppository.

As Dave shuffled towards the automatic doors, he felt the air conditioning wash over him like a wave of artificially chilled salvation. The store's interior, with its harsh fluorescent lighting and meticulously organized aisles, presented itself as a labyrinth of consumer choices, each product promising relief, rejuvenation, or reinvention[4]. He meandered past the seasonal display of pool noodles and sunscreen, a cruel reminder of summers past when his biggest concern had been whether to reapply SPF 30 or risk the mild thrill of potential skin damage.

The pharmacy section loomed ahead, a gauntlet of gastro-intestinal solutions that Dave approached with the trepidation of a man facing both salvation and shame. He perused the options, each box and bottle a testament to the myriad ways the human digestive system could betray its owner. Fiber supplements, stool softeners, laxatives of varying intensities – a veritable smorgasbord of excretory aids that made Dave's head spin and his colon clench in anticipation[5].

As he reached for a promising-looking bottle, the overhead speakers crackled to life, assaulting him with the opening notes of "MMMBop." The song triggered a Proustian rush of memories, transporting Dave back to the summer of '97 and the ill-fated Camp Wanakiki adventure that had seared itself into his psyche.

Eleven-year-old Dave had arrived at Camp Wanakiki with a duffel bag full of carefully folded clothes (thanks, Mom) and a stomach full of anxiety. The first few days had been a blur of awkward introductions, mosquito bites, and the ever-present scent of bug spray and adolescent sweat. It wasn't until the third night, during the camp's infamous "Chili Cook-Off and Talent Show Extravaganza," that Dave's body decided to stage its own rebellion.

The chili, a dubious concoction of beans, mystery meat, and what Dave suspected was at least 30% sawdust, had sat in his stomach like a lead weight. As he shuffled onto the creaky stage to perform his painfully rehearsed magic trick, he felt the first ominous gurgle. The next few minutes were a haze of fumbled card tricks and increasingly urgent intestinal warnings. Just as he reached the grand finale – the reveal of the audience member's card (which, in his panic, he had completely forgotten to note) – disaster struck.

The memory of what followed still haunted Dave's nightmares: the horrified gasps, the cruel laughter, the counselor's awkward attempts at damage control. "The show must go on," indeed. Dave had spent the rest of the summer in a self-imposed exile, earning the unfortunate nickname "Dave the Brave" – a moniker dripping with pre-teen sarcasm that followed him well into high school.

Back in the fluorescent present, Dave shook off the memory like a dog emerging from a muddy lake. He grabbed the first bottle of laxatives his hand touched, suddenly eager to complete this awkward transaction and retreat to the safety of his car. As he approached the checkout, he found himself face-to-face with a cashier whose nametag proclaimed her to be "Stephanie!!!" (extra exclamation points and all)[6].

"Find everything okay?" Stephanie!!! chirped, her voice a pitch-perfect imitation of retail enthusiasm.

Dave nodded, avoiding eye contact as he fumbled for his wallet. As Stephanie!!! scanned the laxatives, he imagined her internal monologue, constructing an entire narrative about his sad, constipated life. He pictured her recounting this encounter to her friends later, all of them laughing at the pathetic man and his rebellious bowels.

"That'll be $12.99," Stephanie!!! announced, snapping Dave back to reality. He handed over a crumpled twenty, painfully aware of the sweat beading on his forehead.

"Here's your change, and your receipt is in the bag. Have a great day!"

Dave mumbled a thank you and scurried out of the store, the plastic bag crinkling accusatorily with each step.

Back in his car, Dave sat motionless, the air conditioning struggling against the oppressive heat. He stared at the innocuous white bag on the passenger seat, a pharmaceutical Pandora's box promising relief and yet another small surrender to the indignities of aging. The radio droned on, another saccharine pop hit filling the silence with its empty promises of eternal youth and carefree summers.

As the final notes faded, the DJ's voice cut in, jarringly cheerful: "And that was 'MMMBop' by Hanson! Can you believe it's been 25 years since that song hit the charts? Where does the time go, folks?"

The question hung in the air like the humidity, heavy and inescapable. Dave felt a sudden, overwhelming urge to drive – anywhere, everywhere, away from this parking lot, this town, this life. He imagined himself on the open road, leaving behind his job, his apartment, his carefully cultivated mediocrity. For a moment, he saw himself as he could have been: adventurous, unburdened, free.

But as quickly as it came, the fantasy faded. Dave sighed, started the engine, and pulled out of the parking lot. He had groceries to buy, after all, and the laxatives to take, and tomorrow was another day at the office. As he drove home, he wondered if there was a pill for the kind of constipation he really suffered from – the kind that left him stuck, day after day, in a life that no longer fit.
